- festschrift
- swap direcion of morphims - done

Journal submission
- completeness for arrow bsed conditions
- logical operators: AND, OR, NEG, 
- Existential quantification: relations with backward shift, properties? Adjointness? Not clear. Relation with shift????
- logical characterization of provable entailment

String diagrams
- justifcation of using discrete interfaces
- equivalence of conditions related through split-epi which are iso on nodes
- sibling and double negation rules for morphisms
- encoding of string diagrams vs conditions
- what is the precise correspondence? 
- are they equivalent?
- we induce morphisms on string diagrams, which is sound and complete wrt entailment 

Condition trees
- objects: condition trees 
- morphisms: arbitrary collections of (v,a,w) a:v->w open graph morphism (in any direction)
- composition defined whenever it exists
- conditions on morphisms
  - reflect/preserve satisfaciton (smemantically)
  - reflect satisfaciton structurally (standard/doble negation (convolution) rule/sibling rule)
  - preserve satisfaciton structurally (child rule forall)
- typing morphisms according to properties leading to several categories
